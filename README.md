# DataStructures
  
**Need for Data Structure**
 
As applications are getting complex and data rich, there are three common problems that applications face now-a-days.

* **Data Search**
* **Processor speed** 
* **Multiple requests**

## Abstract Data Type
- An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is the specification of a data type within some programming language, independent of an implementation. The interface for the ADT is defined in terms of a type and a set of operations on that type. 
- The behaviour of each operation is determined by its inputs and outputs. An ADT does not specify how the data type is implemented. These implementation details are hidden from the user of the ADT and protected from outside access, a concept referred to as Encapsulation.

- A data structure is the implementation for an ADT. In an object-oriented language like Java, an Abstract Data Type and its implementation together make up a class. Each operation associated with the ADT is implemented by a member, function or method.
- The variables that define the space required by a data item are referred to as data members. An object is an instance of a class, that is, something that is created and takes up storage during the execution of a computer program.
